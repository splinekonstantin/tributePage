# Tribute Page about Scotty Cranmer
@freecodecamp Tribute Page Responsive Web Design Project

Uses: <b>HTML5, CSS, Font-Awesome</b>.

In this project I practiced my HTML5 and CSS skills, used Font Awesome icons. 
Also worked with <iframe> element: made it responsive and made it to show the latest video from Scotty's Youtube channel.
