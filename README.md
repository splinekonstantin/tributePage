# Tribute Page about Scotty Cranmer
@freecodecamp Tribute Page Responsive Web Design Project

A single-page responsive website with Font Awesome icons.

Uses: **HTML5, CSS, Font-Awesome**.

In this project I practiced my HTML5 and CSS skills, used Font Awesome icons. 
Also worked with `<iframe>` element: made it responsive and made it to show the latest video from Scotty's Youtube channel.
